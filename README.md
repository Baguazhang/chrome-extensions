Improved "new tab" in Chrome
=================

A simple chrome extension that features:
 * A new "improved" tab page
 * Automatically syncs bookmarks
 * "Quick search" capibilities
 * Persistent notepad
 * Favicons

To customoize the search bars on the new page:

 * Edit the nodes under the "AddSearch" function in tab.js
 * The AddSearch node must equal the id tag in the start-page.html
 * Edit the URL to the custom domains query link.
 * Test in Chrome

Added some color, will update in future with a way to change it, possibly via the chrome options menu.
Added a throttle to the start page.

Here is an explaination of how to load the extension into Chrome.
